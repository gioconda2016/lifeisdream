                     You<br>
                     That with unflinching duty to your King,<br>
                     Till countermanded by the mightier Power,<br>
                     Have held your Prince a captive in the tower,<br>
                     Henceforth as strictly guard him on the throne<br>
                     No less my people's keeper than my own.<br>
                     You stare upon me all, amazed to hear<br>
                     The word of civil justice from such lips<br>
                     As never yet seem'd tuned to such discourse.<br>
                     But listenâ€”In that same enchanted tower,<br>
                     Not long ago I learn'd it from a dream<br>
                     Expounded by this ancient prophet here;<br>
                     And which he told me, should it come again,<br>
                     How I should bear myself beneath it; not<br>
                     As then with angry passion all on fire,<br>
                     Arguing and making a distemper'd soul;<br>
                     But ev'n with justice, mercy, self-control,<br>
                     As if the dream I walk'd in were no dream,<br>
                     A dream it was in which I thought myself,<br>
                     And you that hail'd me now then hail'd me King,<br>
                     In a brave palace that was all my own,<br>
                     Within, and all without it, mine; until,<br>
                     Drunk with excess of majesty and pride,<br>
                     Methought I tower'd so high and swell'd so wide,<br>
                     That of myself I burst the glittering bubble,<br>
                     That my ambition had about me blown,<br>
                     And all again was darkness. Such a dream<br>
                     As this in which I may be walking now;<br>
                     Dispensing solemn justice to you shadows,<br>
                     Who make believe to listen; but anon,<br>
                     With all your glittering arms and equipage,<br>
                     King, princes, captains, warriors, plume and steel,<br>
                     Ay, ev'n with all your airy theatre,<br>
                     May flit into the air you seem to rend<br>
                     With acclamation, leaving me to wake<br>
                     In the dark tower; or dreaming that I wake<br>
                     From this that waking is; or this and that<br>
                     Both waking or both dreaming; such a doubt<br>
                     Confounds and clouds our mortal life about.<br>
                     And, whether wake or dreaming, this I know,<br>
                     How dream-wise human glories come and go;<br>
                     Whose momentary tenure not to break,<br>
                     Walking as one who knows he soon may wake,<br>
                     So fairly carry the full cup, so well<br>
                     Disorder'd insolence and passion quell,<br>
                     That there be nothing after to upbraid<br>
                     Dreamer or doer in the part he play'd,<br>
                     Whether To-morrow's dawn shall break the spell,<br>
                     Or the Last Trumpet of the eternal Day,<br>
                     When Dreaming with the Night shall pass away.<br>
                     (Exeunt.)<br>
