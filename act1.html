                    Once more the storm has roar'd itself away,<br>
                    Splitting the crags of God as it retires;<br>
                    But sparing still what it should only blast,<br>
                    This guilty piece of human handiwork,<br>
                    And all that are within it. Oh, how oft,<br>
                    How oft, within or here abroad, have I<br>
                    Waited, and in the whisper of my heart<br>
                    Pray'd for the slanting hand of heaven to strike<br>
                    The blow myself I dared not, out of fear<br>
                    Of that Hereafter, worse, they say, than here,<br>
                    Plunged headlong in, but, till dismissal waited,<br>
                    To wipe at last all sorrow from men's eyes,<br>
                    And make this heavy dispensation clear.<br>
                    Thus have I borne till now, and still endure,<br>
                    Crouching in sullen impotence day by day,<br>
                    Till some such out-burst of the elements<br>
                    Like this rouses the sleeping fire within;<br>
                    And standing thus upon the threshold of<br>
                    Another night about to close the door<br>
                    Upon one wretched day to open it<br>
                    On one yet wretcheder because one more;—<br>
                    Once more, you savage heavens, I ask of you—<br>
                    I, looking up to those relentless eyes<br>
                    That, now the greater lamp is gone below,<br>
                    Begin to muster in the listening skies;<br>
                    In all the shining circuits you have gone<br>
                    About this theatre of human woe,<br>
                    What greater sorrow have you gazed upon<br>
                    Than down this narrow chink you witness still;<br>
                    And which, did you yourselves not fore-devise,<br>
                    You registered for others to fulfil!<br>
